> fire walk with me

a KISS floating x11 window manager fueled by coffee and cherry pies (wip)

## why

i saw the abbreviation of David Lynch's movie [Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me](https://letterboxd.com/film/twin-peaks-fire-walk-with-me) (fwwm) and it reminded me of window managers _because it ends with wm!_ so i made one :)

although functional, this is mostly a toy project and there are far better options out there. i'm just learning more about x11 and window managers in general
